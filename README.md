# Car-Racing-Game
Built an interactive Car Racing Game using Python (Pygame). The game features smooth player controls, moving lane effects, enemy cars with increasing speed, collision detection, and a live scoring system. This project enhanced my skills in game development, event handling, and object collision logic.
